# Bento Cats Project

## [Live Demo](https://bento-cats-project.vercel.app)

## Deployment using Vercel

## Description

You will be building a Pinterest-like photo wall using cat photos and facts! (see simple example below) The wall should be built using one of the frameworks outlined in the Specs section and data needed will be provided by two separate APIs. There are a few features that we would like the img wall to have outlined in the Specs section but feel free to expand on those specs.

## Features

Some of the following specs are more ambiguous in nature. Feel free to interpret those specs in the way that you deem is best.

-   [x] Use one of the following frameworks to build the project: React, Angular, or Vue
-   [x] Use cat images from http://thecatapi.com/api/images/get?format=xml&results_per_page=25
-   [x] Use cat facts from https://catfact.ninja/facts?limit=25. You may need to use a CORS proxy like one of these: cors proxy, cors anywhere.
-   [ ] Allow users to sort photos alphabetically by the last word in the cat fact
-   [x] Allow users to “favorite” an image (with attached fact) and allow users to view only favorited images
-   [x] Allow users to view one photo and fact at a time
